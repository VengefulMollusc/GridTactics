Sanity system.
perhaps no health? only mental damage
characters who lose all sanity become inhuman

multiple types of sanity damage
visual/audio
can be more succeptible to one or the other (earplug accessories lessen audio damage etc)

psychic powers?
perhaps aquired by rescuing characters from near insanity

enemies react to 'perception' of the player characters
change state or position when not visible?
